Selenium COde i client
Browser is a servier
Every browser has its own browser driver
Code dos not communicate directly with browser code communicates with browser driver whihc we need to download and we give path for this.
Browser driver is a server whihc acts as middleman between selenium code and browser.
------------------------------------------------------
Step1: After we trigger the test the whole Selenium code is converted into JSON format.
Step2: This Json format is sent to the respected browser driver through http protocol.
Step3: Browser driver communicates with its respected browser and executes the command.
Step4: Now browser sends back the response to the the browser driver and it is send to the client in the form of JSON.
